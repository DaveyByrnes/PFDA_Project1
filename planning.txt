Sets that would be good for analysis

MH3 - The modern standard. Will be a good vehicle to explain competitiveness
and card mechanics
LTR - One Ring, Orcish Bowmasters, combination with Sheoldred, how one set
causes value in another
CMM - commander popularity
lea - alpha scarcity
leb - beta scarcity

need to figure out how to combine price with sets

Part One - Card Features and Mana Cost
Modern Horizons
analyse manaValue in a histogram
analyse card types
create chart of most frequent keywords - density
power vs toughness - does the set favour glass cannons or big defense?

Part Two - usage
legalities in json
permission and price availability
most alpha cards have zero usage in modern tournaments because
they aren't legal.
Pie/Bar showing legality of Alpha Cards in 202X.

Use EDHREC
manually create CSV from top MH3 cards
Correlate mana value/number of keywords equals usage
more keywords, more often used??

Complexity Comparsion between MH3 and Alpha
Power Creep visual

Outliers of Alpha Cards with high usage, reprints
alpha versions of cards may be rare, but there are reprints

Part 3 - value

Combine json with manual csv values
current prices usd/eur, original release year, reserved list?
pd merge

scatter plot of EDHREC usage vs price, colours to denote sets

analysis portion

reserved list - unreprintable cards creating price floor
reserved list policy from WOTC

Cross Set Synergy
Sheoldred effect
combo cards exploding old cards from old sets

True Value of Cards
