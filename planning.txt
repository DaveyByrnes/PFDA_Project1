Sets that would be good for analysis

MH3 - The modern standard. Will be a good vehicle to explain competitiveness
and card mechanics
LTR - One Ring, Orcish Bowmasters, combination with Sheoldred, how one set
causes value in another
CMM - commander popularity
lea - alpha scarcity
leb - beta scarcity

need to figure out how to combine price with sets
