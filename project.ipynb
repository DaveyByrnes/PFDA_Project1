    "\n",
    "Magic: The Gathering - which I will refer to throughout this project as MTG or *Magic* - is a collectible trading card game. In the game, players amass cards and assemble them into decks, which they use to play against other players.This is a *gross* over-simplification of the game - in fact, MIT considers Magic to be [\"officially the world's most complex game.\"](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/05/07/135482/magic-the-gathering-is-officially-the-worlds-most-complex-game/) We're not going to delve into all of the complexities here, instead, this project is going to focus on a very specific aspect of this game: its economy."

    "### How do people acquire Magic Cards?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Magic* has been on the go since 1993. The primary way that *Magic* cards are released is through what are known as **Sets**. Cards are created usually with a specific artistic and fantastical theme and are group released together in a set. Sets then are sold through **booster boxes**, a number of randomly assigned cards placed into a box and sold on market, or in similar smaller collections known as **packs**. \n",
    "\n",
    "As *Magic* is a collectible card game, not all of the cards are readily available to the average consumer. Completing a set through booster boces or packs alone would require the purchase of a large quantity of sealed product. This scarcity incentivises trading between players - however more recently, the option to buy a single card online has grown in popularity. This secondary market provides a measureable proxy for card scarcity through observed prices. This will be analysed later."
